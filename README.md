this shader test is a simplification of how to incorporate the shaders found on shadertoy into open frameworks programs.

In this case, two shaders, stored as text and linked within the program itself, are used to generate cycling graphics on the screen.

I have been working with elements which incorporate perlinesque noise in openGL to increase the speed of rendering. These may eventually become graphics overlays for altering other elements of images.

For now, however, this is a small step towards something larger.

This is how the two shaders will look when compiled.
